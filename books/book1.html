            I'm checking off the list<Br>
            of everything I need for school.<br>

            tons of other stuff<br>

            My cuddle bear,<br>
            my magic wand,<br>
            my superhero cape,<br>
            two flashlights, and a tool set,<br>
            in case I must escape.
        </p>
        <p>
                Huh? Mom says to put those things<br>
            back where I took them from.<br>
            She says I won't need that stuff.<br>
            She promised school won't be too rough.<br>
            I hope she's right...<br>
            I really do 'cause...<br>

        <h2>My Teacher</h2>
        <p>
                My teacher did a magic trick<br>
            the minute that I came.<br>
            I don't know how, but <b>-Presto-Poof!-</b><br>
            she somehow knew my name!
        </p>
        <p>
                Then <b>-Bam!-</b>she figured out I'm nice<br>
            and that I'm really smart.<br>
            And just like that she seemed to know <br>
            how good I am at art!
        </p>
        <p>
                I think she used some magic spells<br>
            to make the whole day fun.<br>
            Of all the teachers in the world,<br>
            I'm glad that she's <e><b>my</b></e> one!
        </p>
        <h2>Crisscross<br>Applesauce</h2>
        <p>
                Crisscross applesauce, that's the way we sit.<br>
            Not feet out sauerkraut.<br>
            Not cottage cheese on your knees<br>
            Not bottoms-up coffee cup.
            Not bluberry jelly on your belly.<br>
            But crisscross applesauce, thats the way we sit!

            My tounge felt something missing,<br>
            and I had a little hunch.<br>
            Out came a tiny pebble,<br>
            all shiny, smooth, and white.<br>
            <b>"HEY, LOOK! THE TOOTH FAIRY'S<br>

        <h2>Counting Craze!</h2>
        <p>
                There are 22 children here in room 109,<br>
            a guinea pig, 3 goldfish, and 1 cuddle bear-mine!<br>
            There's a really nice teacher with 8 buttons on her dress<br>
            and 1 billion purple polka dots (more or less).<br>
            There are 39 crayons that fell out of the box,<br>
            53 cars, and 87 blocks.<br>
            24 food cans in our make-believe shop...<br>
            I'v learned how to count.<br>

        <h2>No Nap Rap</h2>
        <p>
                I'm not tired.<br>
            I'm not sleepy.<br>
            I'm wide awake, you see!<br>
            It's daytime.<br>
            It's my playtime.<br>

        <h2>Field Trip</h2>
        <p>
                Hooray! Hooray! A field trip day!<br>
            Adventure's in the air!<br>
            Driver, driver please don't stop<br>
            until you get us there!
        </p>
        <p>
                We squeal and hoot, we screech and roar<br>
            and stomp the whole way through,<br>
            just like a bunch of animals<br>
            until we reach the zoo!
        </p>
        <h2>Best Friends</h2>
        <p>
                Heather was my best friend<br>
            this morning on the bus,<br>
            but she talked so much to Shauna <br>
            that I made my best friend Gus.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
                But Gus said he was Noah's friend<br>
            and wouldn't take it back-<br>
            so I had to go and trade him<br>
            for a better best friend, Zack.
        </p>
        <p>
                Zack wouldn't share<br>
            the box of blocks,<br>
            so what else could I do?<br>
            At lunchtime, I sat right down beside<br>
            my newest best friend, Sue.
        </p>
        <p>
                Then Sue ate half my cupckake.<br>
            I didn't say she could!
            In Art I was All by myself-<br>
            I was done with friends for good!
        </p>
        <p>
                Then someone came and asked me,<br>
            "Can we paint together?"
        </p>
        <p>
                So... on the bus ride home again,<br>
            my new, NEW best friend was Heather.
        </p>
        <h2>George</h2>
        <p>
                I have a kindergarten friend who isn't very big.<br>
            I'm talking about George Washington, our classroom guinea pig.<br>
            I always stop to talk to him about the stuff we like.<br>
            I'm always teaching him his ABCs and how to draw a heart.<br>
            He always pays attention - that George is clearly very smart!        
        </p>
        <h2>100th Day of School</h2>
        <p>
                I brought 1OO marbles<br>
            inside my plastic cup.<br>
            Zack brought 1OO chocolate chips<br>
            (till someone ate them up).
        </p>
        <p>
                Nina's 1OO toothpicks<br>
            all came inside 1 box.<br>
            Alia brought a picture<br>
            of her 1OO chicken pox.<br>
            I used to think 1OO <br>
            was a lot when I was small,<br>
            but now that it's the 1OOth day,<br>
            I am old enough to say - <br>
            1OO isn't all that many many days at all!
        </p>
        <h2>Show-and-Tell</h2>
        <p>
                Today's my turn for show-and-tell,<br>
            but somehow I forgot!<br>
            I could have brought in cuddle bear<br>
            or else my new robot.<br>
            I could have brought my snow globe<br>
            or my cool vacation hat.<br>
            I could have brought my gold fish-<br>
            exept I didn't think of that.<br>
            So now my hands are empty<br>
            and my teacher's calling me!<br>
            But hang on! I see something<br>
            staring right in front of me. 
        </p>
        <p>
                Quick! I draw 2 dots<br>
            on my finger while I stand.<br>
            Then I make my thumb into a mouth-<br>
            <h3><b>"Hi, class. Please meet my HAND!"</b></h3>
        </p>
        <h2>Line Leaders</h2>
        <p>
                "Line-up time!"
            It's a race!<br>
            Everybody wants first place!<br>
            But I go s l o w l y ...<br>
            I dont run ...<br>
            'cause I'm the line leader.<br>
            I was picked the line leader.<br>
            So make way, kids, <br>
            For number one!    
        </p>
        <h2>Growing Seeds</h2>
        <p>
                We planted seeds in paper cups<br>
            and put on the sill<br>
            We watered them<br>
            and watched...<br>
            and watched...<br>
            and those cups until...
        </p>
        <p>
                I peeked today and - check it out - <br>
            a little baby seedling sprouting out
        </p>
        <h2>Growing Me</h2>
        <p>
                What happend to my favorite pants?<br>
            The ones that used to fit.<br>
            Now they come up to my knees<br>
            when I try to sit.<br>
            My toes can't wiggle in my shoes<br>
            the way they used to do.<br>
            I think someone shrunk my clothes.<br>
            Or could it be I grew?
        </p>
        <h2>Last Day</h2>
        <p>
                I hugged my teacher -<br>
            "Please don't cry!"<br>
            And she said "Beg your pardon?"<br>
            I said, "We're going to first grade,<br>
            but you're stuck in kindergarten!"
