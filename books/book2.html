                Hello! My name is Emily Elizabeth, and this is my dog, Clifford<br>
            I started kindergarten yesterday.<br>
            At first, I was scared, but now I love school.
        </p>
        <p>
                Before school started, my mom read me a book about what my first day of <br>
            kindergarten would be like. She said I would make lots of new friends and<br>
            learn all about writing, counting, animals, and my nieghborhood.
        </p>
        <p>
                We went to see my new school. Clifford stayed outside.<br>
            but just knowing he was close by made me feel better.
        </p>
        <p>
                We met my teacher, Mrs. Tate, and she showed <br>
            us around the classroom. She was very nice.
        </p>
        <p>
                We visited the nurse's office. If I ever<br>
            feel sick, the nurse will take care of me. 
        </p>
        <p>
                Later, we played school in my backard. I was the teacher, and my<br>
            mom and Clifford were my students. I tried to be like Mrs. Tate.
        </p>
        <p>
                I still had a few questions for my mom. I asked her what would happen<br>
            if I missed home, or if I didn't make any frieds.<br>
            She said that Mrs. Tate would help me feel better if I was sad. She would <br>
            also make sure that I didn't have to play by myself.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next day Clifford and I were plaing hide-and-seek <br>
            when a letter came in the mail. It was from my teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
            The letter said that each kindergartener could bring something <br>
            from home to school on the first day to help make then feel <br>
            comfortable. I know exactly what to bring!
        </p>
        <p>
                On the first day of kindergarten, Mrs. Tate greeted us at the classroom door.<br>
            She was vers surprised to see Clifford. All the other kids brought stuffed<br>
            animals, toys, or blankets. They all smiled when they saw Clifford.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was time for school to start. I said good-bye to my mom.
        </p>
        <p>
            We all sat in a circle, and Mrs. Tate taught us a welcome song. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Clifford tried to sing along too, but all he could do was howl.
        </p>
        <p>
                Then we all took turns going to the front of the class to answer a question<br>
            on the board. Mrs. Tate asked the question. Did you play outside this weekend. and we wrote yes or no.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even Clifford had a turn.
        </p>
        <p>
                We practiced writing letters and words. Some kids were nervous about<br>
            writing. Clifford gave them kisses to help them feel better.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unfortunately his kisses were very slobery.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, Ms. Tate asked us to paint a picture of home.
        </p>
        <p>
                Clifford missed home as much as I did. When he saw my painting, he started <br>
            wagging his tail really fast. OOPS! He knocked over some of the water and <br>
            paint with his tail.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clifford rolled around on the floor to try and clean it up.
        </p>
        <p>
                Finally it was time for lunch. I was so hungry!<br>
            So was Clifford.
        </p>
        <p>
                Everyone loved Clifford so much they wanted to give him treats.<br>
            But Mrs. Tate said we needed our own food so we could have<br>
            energy for the rest of the school day.
        </p>
        <p>
            At recess, everyone wanted to play with Clifford.<br>
            We made a lot of friends on the playground.
        </p>
        <p>
            Clifford's tail is a great jump rope.<br>
            And his nose is the best slide!
        </p>
        <p>
            At naptime, we were all tired from playing outside.<br>
            But we weren't used to sleeping on th rug.<br>
            It was hard to get comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Thats when Clifford had an idea!
        </p>
        <p>
            Clifford let everyone snuggle up with him. Soon we all fell fast asleep.<br>
            Ms. Tate was happy we were able to nap. We still had a long school<br>
            day ahead of us.                        
        </p>
        <p>
            Clifford saved naptime! We woke up ready for the rest of the school day
        </p>
        <p>
            Bringing Clifford to my first day of kindergarten was a big success!<br>
            I can't wait to go back to school tomorrow.
