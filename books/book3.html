                Chester Raccoon stood at the <br>
            edge of the forest and cried.
        </p>
                "I don't want to go to school," he told his <br>
            mother. "I want to stay home with you. I want <br>
            to play with my friends. And play with my<br>
            toys. And read my books. And swing on my swing.<br>
            Please let me stay home with you?"
        </p>
        <p>
                Mrs. Raccoon took Chester by the hand <br>
            and nuzzled him on the ear.
        </p>
        <p>
                "Sometimes we all have to do things we<br>
            don't want to do," she told him gently. "Even <br>
            if they seem strange and scary at first. But you<br>
            will love school once you start."
        </p>
        <p>
                "You'll make new friends. And play with new toys."
        </p>
        <p>
                "Read new books. And swing on new swings. Besides," she<br>
            added. "I know a wonderful secret that will make your nights <br>
            at school seem as warm and cozy as your days at home."                
        </p>
        <p>
                Chester wiped away his tears and <br>
            looked interested. "A secret? What kind <br>
            of secret?"
        </p>
        <p>
                "A very old secret," said Mrs. Raccoon.<br>
            "I learned it from my mother, and she<br>
            learned it from hers. It's called the <br>
            Kissing Hand"
        </p>
        <p>
                "The Kissing Hand?" asked Chester.<br>
            "What's that?"
        </p>
        <p>
                "I'll show you."Mrs. Raccoon took Chester's<br>
            left hand and spread open his tiny fingers into a fan.<br>
            Leaning forward, she kissed Chester right in the <br>
            middle of his palm.                         
        </p>
        <p>
                Chester felt his mother's kiss rush from his hand,<br>
            up his arm, and into his heart. Even his silky, black<br>
            mask tingled with warmth.
        </p>
        <p>
                Mrs. Raccoon smiled. "Now," she<br>
            told Chester, "whenever you feel lonely<br>
            and need a little loving from home,<br>
            just press your hand to your cheek and<br>
            think, 'Mommy loves you. Mommy<Br>
            loves you.' And that very kiss will jump<br>
            to your face and fill you with toasty<br>
            warm thoughts."
        </p>
        <p>
                She took Chester's hand and<br>
            carefully wrapped his fingers around<br>
            the kiss. "Now, do be careful not to<br>
            lose it," she teased him. "But, don't worry.<br>
            When you open your hand and wash your<br>
            food, I promise the kiss will stick."     
        </p>
        <p>
                Chester loved his Kissing Hand. Now he knew<br>
            his mother's love would go with him wherever he went.<br>
            Even to school.                 
        </p>
        <p>
                That night, Chester stood in front<br>
            of his school and looked thoughtful.<br>
            Suddenly, he turned to his mother and<br>
            grinned.
        </p>
        <p>
                "Give me your hand," he told her.
        </p>
        <p>
                Chester took his mother's hand<br>
            in his own and unfolded her large, familiar<br>
            fingers into a fan. Next, he leaned forward<br>
            and kissed the center of her hand.              
        </p>
        <p>
                "Now you have a Kissing Hand, too,"<br>
            he told her. And with a gentle "Good-bye" and<br>
            "I love you," Chester turned and danced away.
        </p>
        <p>
                Mrs. Raccoon wached Chester scamper accross a<br>
            tree limb and enter school. And as the hoot owl rangin<br>
            the new school year, she pressed her left hand to her<br>
            cheek and smiled.                 
        </p>
        <p>
                The warmth of Chester's kiss filled her heart with<br>
            special words<br>
                "Chester loves you," it sang. "Chester loves you."
