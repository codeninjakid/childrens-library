                If you take a mouse to school,
            he'll ask you for your lunchbox.
        </p>
        <p>
                When you give him your lunchbox,<br>
            he'll want a sandwich-<br>
            and a snack for later.<br>
            Then he'll need a notebook<br>
            and some pencils.<br>
            He'll probably want to share your backpack, took
        </p>
        <p>
            When you get to school,<br>
            he'll put things<br>
            in your locker<br>
            and take a look around.
        </p>
        <p>
                He might do a little math,<br>
            and spell a word or two.<br>
            He'll even try a science expirement!
        </p>
        <p>
                Then he'll need to wash up.<br>
            You'll have to take him to the bathroom.<br>
            Once he's nice and clean,<br>
            he'll be ready for his lunch.<br>
            On the way to the lunchroom,<br>
            he'll see some building blocks.<br>
            He'll build a little mouse house<br>
            and make furniture out of clay.
        </p>
        <p>
                Then he'll need some books<br>
            for his bookshelf.<br>
            HE'll start by writing<br>
            one of his own,<br>
            so he'll need a lot of paper.<br>
            He'll probably use up all<br>
            your pencils.<br>
            When he's finished,<br>
            he'll want to read his book to you.<br>
            Then he'll want to take it home.<br>
            So he'll put it in your lunchbox,<br>
            and tuck it in a safe place.
        </p>
        <p>
                When the bell rings.<br>
            he'll run out to wait for the bus.
        </p>
        <p>
                Then he'll ask you to<br>
            shoot a few baskets,<br>
            and do a little skateboarding.
        </p>
        <p>
            When he stops to take a breath,<br>
            he'll want to eat a snack.<br>
            So he'll ask you for your . . .<br>
            lunchbox.<br>
            and chances are, <br>
            if he asks you for your lunchbox,<br>
            you'll have to take him<br>
            back to school.
