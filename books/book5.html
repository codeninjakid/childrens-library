                Wemberly worried about everything.<br>
            Big things, "I wanted to make sure you were still here."<br>
            Little things, and things in between.<br>
            "Mama, what if I shrink?"<br>
            Wemberly worried in the morning, she worried at night, and she worried throughout the day.<br>
            "You worry too much," said her mother.<br>
            "When you worry, I worry" said her father.<br>
            "Worry, worry, worry," said her grandmother. "Too much worry."<br>
            At home, Wemberly worried about the tree in the front yard.<br>
            "What if it falls on our house?"<br>
            And the crack in the living room wall.<br>
            "What if it gets bigger and something comes out of it?"<br>
            And the noise the radiators made.<br>
            "What if there's a snake inside?"<br>
            At the playground, Wemberly worried about the chains on the swings, and the bolts on the slide,<br>
            And the bars on the jungle gym.<br>
            "Too rusty. Too loose. Too high."<br>
            And always, she worried about her doll Petal.<br>
            "Shouldn't Petal have a car seat too?"<br>
            "Petal's lost forever!"<br>
            "I found her sweetie!"<br>
            "I'll wait for you, Petal."<br>
            "Don't worry," said her mother. "Don't worry," said her father.<br>
            But Wemberly worried. She worried and worried and worried.<br>
            When Wemberly was especiall worried, she rubbed Petal's ears.<br>
            Wemberly worried that if she didn't stop worrying, Petal would have no ears left at all.<br>
            On her birthday, Wemberly worried that no one would come to her party.<br>
            "See?" said her mother. "There was nothing to worry about."<br>
            But Wemberly worried that there wouldn't be enough cake.<br>
            On Halloween, Wemberly worried that there would be too many butterflies in the neighborhood parade.<br>
            "See?" said her father. "There was nothing to worry about."<br>
            But then Wemberly worried because she was the only one.<br>
            "You worry too much," said her mother. "When you worry, I worry," said her father. "Worry, worry, worry," said her grandmother. "Too much worry."<br>
            Soon, Wemberly had a new worry: school.<br>
            Wemberly worried about the start of school more than anything she had ever worried about before. "I loved school."<br>
            By the time the first day arrived, Wemberly had a long list of worries.<br>
            "What if no one else has spots? What if no one else wears stripes? What if no one else brings a doll? What if the teacher is mean? What if the room smells bad?"<br>
            "What if they make fun of my name? What if I can't find the bathroom? What if I hate the snack? What if I have to cry?"<br>
            "Don't worry," said her mother. "Don't worry," said her father.<br>
            But Wemberly worried. She worried and worried and worried.<br>
            She worried all the way there. "Have fun!"<br>
            While Wemberly's parents talked to the teacher, Mrs. Peachem, Wemberly looked around the room.<br> 
            Then Mrs. Peachem said, "Wemberly, there is someone I think you should meet."<br>
            Her name was Jewel. She was standing by herself. She was wearing stripes. She was holding a doll.<br>
            At first, Wemberly and Jewel just peeked at each other.<br>
            "This is Petal," said Wemberly. "This is Niblet," said Jewel.<br>
            Petal waved. Niblet waved back. "Hi," said Petal. "Hi," said Niblet.<br>
            "I rub her ears," said Wemberly. "I rub her nose," said Jewel.<br>
            Throughout the morning, Wemberly and Jewel sat side by side and played together whenever they could.<br>
            Petal and Niblet sat side by side too.<br>
            Wemberly worried, but no more than usual, and sometimes even less.<br>
            Before Wemberly knew it, it was time to go home.<br>
            "Come back tomorrow!" called Mrs. Peachem as the students walked out the door.<br>
            Wemberly turned and smiled and waved. "I will," she said. "Don't worry!"<br>
