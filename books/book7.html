                HEY, KIDS!<br>
            You will never be<br>
            eaten by a T. rex.<br>
            They are extinct.<br>
            I promise!
        </p>
        <p>
                Penelope Rex was nervous.<br>
            It's not every day a<br>
            little T. rex starts school.
        </p>
        <p>
                "What are my classmates going to be like?<br>
            Will they be nice?<br>
            How many teeth will they have?"
        </p>
        <p>
                This was very important.
        </p>
        <p>
                Penelope's mom  bought her a new backpack<br>
            with ponies on it.
        </p>
        <p>
                Ponies were Penelope's favorite.<br>
            Because ponies are delicious.
        </p>
        <p>
                Penelope's dad packed her a lunch of three hundred<br>
            tuna sandwich and one apple juice.
        </p>
        <p>
                Finally, the big day came,<br>
            and Penelope Rex was very surprised to find out<br>
            that all of her classmates were. . .
        </p>
        <h3>CHILDREN!</h3>
        <p>
                So she ate them.<br>
            Because children are delicious.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
                "Penelope Rex!" said Mrs. Noodleman.<br>
            "WE DON'T EAT<br>
            OUR CLASSMATES!<br>
            Please spit them<br>
            out at once!"<br>
            So she did
        </p>
        <p>
                It was NOT the best way to start school.<br>
            Still, Penelope was determined to have a good first day.<br>            
        </p>
        <p>
                She tried to make friends at recess.<br>
            She finger-painted some of her best work.<br>
            She even saved Griffin Emery a seat at lunch.<br>
            "You can sit here."
        </p>
        <p>
                Penelope started to notice<br>
            everyone was making friends<br>
            but her. It was lonely.
        </p>
        <p>
                When she got home, her<br>
            dad aked her about her first<br>
            doy of school.
        </p>
        <p>
                "I didn't make any friends!"<br>
            Penelope cried. "None of<br>
            the children wanted<br>
            to play with me!"
        </p>
        <p>
                "Penelope Rex," her father asked,<br>
            "did you eat your classmates?"<br>
            "Well...maybe sort of<br>
            just a little bit."
        </p>
        <p>
                "Sometimes it's hard to make friends,"<br>
            said her dad.
        </p>
        <p>
                "Especially if you eat them."
        </p>
        <p>
                "You see, Penelope, children are the<br>
            same as us on the inside. Just tastier."
        </p>
        <p>
            That gave<br>
            Penelope<br>
            a LOT to<br>
            think about.
        </p>
        <p>
                The next day Penelope<br>
            tried REALLY hard!<br>
        </p>
        <p>
                But poor Penelope<br>
            She could not stop herself<br>
            from eating her classmates.<br>
            "Mrs. Noodleman, Penelope ate William Omoto again!"
        </p>
        <p>
                And they were all afraid of her.
        </p>
        <p>
                Exept Walter...Walter was a goldfish.<br>
            So Penelope tried to<br>
            make friends with him. "Will you be my friend?"
        </p>
        <p>
            <h3>Chomp!</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
                "EEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!"<br>
            cried Penelope.<br>
            "He's eating my finger!"<br>
            "WAAAAHHHHH!"
        </p>
        <p>
                Once Penelope found out what<br>
            it was like to be someone's snack,<br>
            she lost her appetite for children.
        </p>
        <p>
                She stopped eating her classmates...<br>
            (Even when Cece Woodman<br>
            spilled BBQ sauce<br>
            all over herself.) 
        </p>
        <p>
                And soon Penelope<br>
            made friends!
        </p>
        <p>
                Now, even when children look especially delicious,<br>
            she peeks at Walter and remembers what it's like<br>
            when someone tries to eat you.
        </p>
        <p>
                And Walter the goldfish, stares right back<br>
            at her
        </p>
        <p>
            Becouse dinosaurs are delicious.
