                Every morning, Peppa and George<br>
            brush their teeth.<b>Brush! Brush! Brush! </b>
        </p>
        <h3>Brush! Brush! Brush!</h3>
        <p>
                "George, are your teeth <br>
            as clean as mine?" Peppa asks,<br>
            showing off her shiny white teeth.
        </p>
        <p>
                "You both have lovely clean teeth.<br>
            I'm sure the dentist will be happy!"<br>
            calls out Daddy Pig
        </p>
        <p>
                Later that day, Peppa and George<br>
            are at the dentist's office, waiting for their<br>
            checkups. It is George's first visit.
        </p>
        <p>
                "Peppa! George! The dentist will see <br>
            you now," says Miss Rabbit, the nurse<br>
            "Hooray!" they both cheer.`
        </p>
        <p>
                Peppa and George meet Doctor Elephant, the dentist.<br>
            "I'm first," replies Peppa. "I'm a big girl.<br>
            Watch me, George!"
        </p>
        <p>
                "Open wide, please," Doctor Elephant says.
        </p>
        <p>
                "Aaaaah!" Peppa opens her mouth as wide as she<br>
            possibly can.
        </p>
        <p>
                "Let's take a look," says Doctor Elephant,<br>
            checking Peppa's teeth with a mirror.
        </p>
        <p>
                "There. All done! What beautiful,<br>
            clean teeth, " says Doctor Elephant.<br>
        "   Now you can rinse your mouth!"
        </p>
        <p>
                Gargle! Ptooou! The pink liquid <br>
            tastes like bubble gum!
        </p>
        <p>
                Peppa spits it out into the sink.<br>
            It's George's turn next.
        </p>
        <p>
                George does not want it to be his turn.<br>
            Doctor Elephant can tell he is nervous so he <br>
            lets George hold Mr. Dinosaur.
        </p>
        <p>
                "All done. You have very strong, clean teeth.<br>
            George!" Doctor Elephant smiles.
        </p>
        <p>
                "But wait! What is this?" cries Doctor Elephant.<br>
            "George has clean teeth, but this young<br>
            dinosaur's teeth are very dirty."
        </p>
        <p>
                "The water jet, please, Miss Rabbit!" orders the<br>
            dentist. He uses the water to clean Mr. Dinosaur's<br>
            teeth.
        </p>
        <p>
                "Pink!" cries George,<br>
            picking up a glass.<br>
            "That's right, George!" says <br>
            Doctor Elephant. "Mr. Dinosaur<br>
            needs to rinse with the <br>
            bubble-gum-flavored drink!"<br>
            Gurgle!
        </p>
        <p>
                "Wow! What shiny teeth you have,<br>
            Mr. Dinosaur," cries Miss Rabbit.
            "Dine-saw! Grrr!" says George.
        </p>
        <p>
                George loves Mr. Dinosaur-<br>
            especially now that he has nice,<br>
            clean teeth!
        </p>
        <p>
            And now Peppa and George have clean teeth, too!
